            <h2>About Me and My Goals</h2>
            <p>I am a junior at the Harriet L. Wilkes Honors College of Florida Atlantic University, majoring in Biochemistry and Data Science & Analytics. My life mission is to take on the things that challenge me in daily life and turn them around: from negatives into positives.</p>
            <p>I have two disabilities that impact my life. I have mild/moderate hearing loss in my left ear, and severe/profound loss in my right ear. I also have a rare, unknown neuromuscular disease that weakens my limbs, which resembles severe symptoms of a genetic disease named Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. My hearing loss can make simple conversation a challenge and can challenge my ability to learn. My neuromuscular disease takes away crucial things for me, including my hand strength, which leads to many limitations in daily life.</p>
            <p>Because I personally understand the mental and physical pains of growing up with disabilities, I want to not only make the lives of individuals facing both hearing loss and neuromuscular disease better, but I feel the desire to work with people, being there for them as someone who understands their situation on a personal level. I am passionate about technology, and how creative ideas can push the boundaries of it. I believe that adaptive technology and advancing scientific knowledge is an important way to make a better, smarter world. Nobody deserves to suffer from a disability, and I want to help.</p>
            
            <h3>Education Experience</h3>
            <p><strong>Harriet L. Wilkes Honors College, Florida Atlantic University</strong> - August 2022 – May 2026<br>
            I have taken classes including higher level maths and sciences and have volunteered in a neuroscience laboratory studying fish brains. I am using my undergraduate time as an opportunity to discover how I can apply love for technology/creativity in the world. I recently lost my ability to walk among other things due to disease progression, which has made balancing academics and mental health challenging, but I am learning to overcome this and rebound.</p>
            
            <h3>Volunteer Experience</h3>
            <p><strong>Muscular Dystrophy Association State Ambassador of Florida</strong> - 2017 – 2019<br>
            As the state ambassador of Florida, I volunteered over four-hundred hours into raising money for neuromuscular disease research and patient care. I had the opportunity to give speeches at public and private events and be involved with my community to share my personal story and spread awareness. I am so grateful to say that I raised over $120,000 for the MDA! This money will fund research and patient care.</p>
