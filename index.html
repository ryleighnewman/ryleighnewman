        <p>I’m a junior at the Harriet L. Wilkes Honors College, majoring in Biochemistry and Data Science and Analytics.</p>
        <p>My life’s mission is to transform challenges into opportunities, drawing from my personal experiences with disabilities.</p>
        <p>I have two disabilities: mild/moderate hearing loss in one ear and severe/profound loss in the other, as well as a rare neuromuscular disease resembling Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, which severely atrophies my limb strength.</p>
        <p>I have recently lost the ability to walk, as my legs have no more functionality. I also recently lost almost all strength in my hands and wrists. This makes daily tasks extremely challenging; it even took my ability to do my favorite hobbies.</p>
        <p>These experiences fuel my passion for helping others, experimenting with adaptive technology, and working to improve the lives of those with disabilities.</p>
        <p>I aspire to use my knowledge and creativity to push the boundaries of technology, making a smarter and more inclusive world.</p>
        <p>Despite the roadblocks, I am turning my hardships around to inspire others and innovate. <strong class="motto">My personal motto is to “Be Awesome.”</strong></p>
