            <p><strong>Muscular Dystrophy Association State Ambassador of Florida: 2017 – 2019</strong></p>
            <p>As the state ambassador of Florida, I volunteered over four-hundred hours into raising money for neuromuscular disease research and patient care. I had the opportunity to give speeches at public and private events and be involved with my community to share my personal story and spread awareness. I am so grateful to say that I raised over $120,000 for the MDA! This money will fund research and patient care.</p>
