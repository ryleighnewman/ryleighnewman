            <p>I’m a sophomore at Harriet L. Wilkes Honors College, majoring in Biochemistry and Data Analytics. My life’s mission is to transform challenges into opportunities, drawing from my personal experiences with disabilities. I have mild/moderate hearing loss in one ear and severe/profound loss in the other, as well as a rare neuromuscular disease resembling Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, which affects my limb strength.</p>
            <p>These experiences fuel my passion for adaptive technology and scientific research aimed at improving the lives of those with disabilities. I aspire to use my knowledge and creativity to push the boundaries of technology, making a smarter and more inclusive world. My personal motto is to “Be Awesome.”</p>
